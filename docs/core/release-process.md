# Review/Release Process

Releases are developed on a monthly cycle.  At the start of the month, the
release-manager will send an invitation to developers who have open PRs,
encouraging them to participate in the release-cycle.  Participation
provides a way to exchange feedback with other developers, get PRs merged,
and ensure the next release works -- all with a predictable timeline.

* For a high-level summary of the release process, see the [Release Management README](https://github.com/civicrm/release-management/blob/master/README.md).
* For an example invitation, see the previous [invitation for the April-May 2016](https://github.com/civicrm/release-management/issues/1).
