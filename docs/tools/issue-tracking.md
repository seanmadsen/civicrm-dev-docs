# Issue-tracking systems

As of 2017 CiviCRM uses three different system for tracking and managing issues (aka tickets). This page offers a brief summary of the systems and helps developers understand when and how to use them.

## Guidelines

* All changes to CiviCRM *Core*, however small, must receive a Jira issue. This helps us assemble the [release notes](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/tree/master/release-notes).
* Changes and contributions to other non-core projects __TODO__

## Jira

Jira is the main system used for CiviCRM *Core*.

## GitHub

[CiviCRM uses GitHub](/tools/git.md#github) to host most of its git repositories. Since GitHub offers issue-tracking functionality along with each repository __TODO__

## GitLab

As of 2017, CiviCRM has begun to use [a private GitLab installation](http://lab.civicrm.org) for some projects.
